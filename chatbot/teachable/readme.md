Your input we will call 'context'<br>
Robot's output we will call 'response' 

1. When you see "Talk" you may do your input. Robot will reply.<br>
2. If Robot replies "I do not know what to say" it means Robot does not know what to say :) Robot will ask: "Teach me", and you can input the response you want.<br>
3. If Robot replies and you don't like it, you can input '!' and press enter. Robot will ask you "Teach me" and you can input the response you want. If Robot's response was not previously recorded the new response(you provided) will be associated with context.<br>
4. If Robot replies and you like it, but also want to add new response, you can input '+' and press enter. Robot will ask you "Teach me" and you can input the response you want. Both responses will be associated with context.<br>
5. One context may have many responses. In case such context will be chosen, Robot will randomly output one of the associated responses.<br>
6. Any tyme you can make empty input and session will be closed. Database will be updated.
